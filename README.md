# LakeContaminationModel2D

Solve a contamination model for the Cajititlan lake with the finite element method in 2D in the space and Euler backward scheme for the time.

It makes use of the binary search method trying to reduce the computation cost of the evaluation of the solution in a rectangular mesh for visualization.
